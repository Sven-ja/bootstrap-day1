    <p>It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of their
        peculiar words and customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had
        in the distant past moved westward.</p>
    <p>Their earliest tales seem to
        glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between
        the eaves of Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains. Why
        they later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of the mountains
        into Eriador is no longer certain. Their own accounts speak of the
        multiplying of Men in the land, and of a shadow that fell on the
        forest, so that it became darkened and its new name was Mirkwood.</p>
    <p>Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already
        become divided into three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots,
        Stoors, and Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner of skin, smaller,
        and shorter, and they were beardless and bootless; their hands and
        feet were neat and nimble; and they preferred highlands and hillsides.
        The Stoors were broader, heavier in build; their feet and hands were
        larger; and they preferred flat lands and riversides. The Fallohides
        were fairer of skin and also of hair, and they were taller and slimmer
        than the others; they were lovers of trees and of woodlands.
        The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, and
        long lived in the foothills of the mountains. They moved westward
        early, and roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the others
        were still in Wilderland.</p>
