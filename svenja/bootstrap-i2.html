            <p>It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of their
                peculiar words and customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had
                in the distant past moved westward.</p>
            <p>Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between
                the eaves of Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains.</p>
            <p>Why they later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of the mountains
                into Eriador is no longer certain.</p>
            <p> Their own accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land, and of a shadow that fell on the
                forest, so that it became darkened and its new name was Mirkwood.</p>
            <p>Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already
                become divided into three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots,
                Stoors, and Fallohides.</p>
            <p> The Harfoots were browner of skin, smaller,
                and shorter, and they were beardless and bootless; their hands and
                feet were neat and nimble; and they preferred highlands and hillsides.</p>
            <p>The Stoors were broader, heavier in build; their feet and hands were
                larger; and they preferred flat lands and riversides.</p>
            <p>The Fallohides were fairer of skin and also of hair, and they were taller and slimmer
                than the others; they were lovers of trees and of woodlands.</p>
            <p>The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, and
                long lived in the foothills of the mountains. They moved westward
                early, and roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the others
                were still in Wilderland.</p>
            <p>They were the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit, and far the most numerous.
            <p>They were the most inclined to settle in one place, and longest preserved their
                ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes.</p>
            <p>The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin,
                and were less shy of Men.</p>
            <p>They came west after the Harfoots and followed the course of the Loudwater southwards; and there many
                of them long dwelt between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland
                before they moved north again.</p>
